# ![morfi logo](docs_src/public/images/form-logo.svg?sanitize=true) morfi
Abstract form handling for any purpose (1.8 kb gzipped)

---

⚒️⚒️⚒️ ATTENTION: Construction work ongoing ⚒️⚒️⚒️

Version 2 will be released soon and introduced massive breaking changes. Morfi@1 was not
state of the art anymore. Back then React hooks where not yet introduced. Also, Morfi was
lacking many interesting features that are build-in into other form handling libs and are
important in very advanced scenarios. E.g. editing of deeply nested data structures,
capturing of dirty fields, possibility to merge live-updates of data into the form fields and
maintaining form data version for multiple submit forms.

All of this had to be implemented using strong type safety as this was the main reason for
implementing Morfi instead of using any other form handling library. Meanwhile, many other
form handling libraries have appeared, but I've tested them and learned from them.

Bad news are that the lib became slightly bigger, almost 3 kB gzipped, but luckily this is
still much smaller than most other libs out there.

Some of the below links do not work properly anymore. You can however navigate through the
code already to get an impression of how the new API looks like.

### Why morfi?

I have invested a lot of time to read about and use forms from different
developers. Since I did not find the *one* solution in my year long
experience with `react`, I decided to spend some time and think about
an ideal solution.

I tried to target the following aspects. It should be a small bundle.
Leave the flexibility to the developer. Make it type safe! Support the usage of any
internationalization framework. Absolutely no dependencies, which have
to be installed additionally. High performing and very assisting.

* `TypeScript` support
* `flow` support
* No dependencies
* Small bundle size
* High performance
* Nice features
* Totally customizable
* Well documented

### Installation
##### With yarn
```
yarn add morfi
```
##### With npm
```
npm install --save morfi
```

### Introduction
Let's get a first impression...
```js
import React from 'react';
import { Morfi, type FormData, type FormValidation } from 'morfi';
 // this can be replaced by any intl framework of your choice
import { myOwnIntlFramework } from 'my-own-intl-framwwork';

// first define your form value types
type MyFormValues = { phone: string };

const initialValues: MyFormValues = { phone: '' };
const initialData: FormData<MyFormValues> = { values: initialValues, errors: {} };
const validation: FormValidation<MyFormValues> = {}; // will be explained later

// initialize the used components
const { Form, Fields } = Morfi.create(initialValues);

// you can initialize the submit callback outside of the component
// if it does not depend on further component state
const onSubmit = (values: MyFormValues) => console.log(values);

const MyForm = () => {
    // you don't have to use hooks (see example below)
    const [data, setData] = React.useState<FormData<MyFormValues>>(initialData);
    
    return (
        <Form validation={validation}
              onChange={setData}
              data={data}
              onSubmit={onSubmit}>
            <Fields.phone>
                {({ onChange, onBlur, required, value, error }) => (
                    <div>
                        <label>{`Phone${required ? ' *' : ''}`}</label>
                        <input value={value} 
                               onChange={e => onChange(e.target.value)}
                               onBlur={e => onBlur(e.target.value)} />
                        <span className="error">{myOwnIntlFramework(error)}</span>
                    </div>
                )}
            </Fields.phone>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </Form>
    );
}
```
By calling `Morfi.create` with the initial values, a `React` context will generated
and you get `Form` element together with `Fields` which itself contains different
elements for each specified initial value. ATTENTION: It is mandatory to supply all
relevant fields. Even values that will be initialized with `undefined`. Because the
keys of your initial values matter.

The `Form` element receives certain "control" props and needs to provide the current
context state to each of the `Fields`.
It expects the following props: (See below for the missing [types](#types))

Props              | Type                                    | Description                                                       | Example
------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------
`className`        | `void \ string`                         | Will be applied to the form tag                                   | `'my-form'`
`validation`       | `FormValidation<V>`                     | Contains all validators                                           | `{ name: { onChange: customValidator } }`
`data`             | `FormData<V>`                           | Contains all values, errors and submitting state                  | `{ values: { name: 'Scotty' }, errors: { name: { id: 'does.not.know' } }, submitting: false }`
`onChange`         | `(FormData<V>) => void`                 | Handles the next data after any changes have been made            |
`onSubmit`         | `V => void \ Promise<void>`             | Will be called if submitted without any failing validators        |
`onSubmitFailed`   | `void \ ((Error, FormData<V>) => void)` | Will be called if submitting was aborted due to validation errors or if your submit returned a rejected promise |
`onSubmitFinished` | `void \ ((FormData<V>) => void)`        | Will be called after submitting finished                          |

In the above example was a single value specified with the key "phone". Hence
`Fields.phone` is a element mapped to the generic type "string". It accepts only
a single child function, which receives the following:

* `value`: The current value of that field. It equals the `data.values.phone`.

* `error`: The current error message of that field. It equals the `data.errors.phone`.

* `onChange`: Receives the next value of the generic type, runs the onChange-Validator on it
and calls the `Form` - `onChange` where e.g. `data.values.phone` holds the
updated value and `data.errors.phone` will maybe hold an occurred validation error.

* `onBlur`: Same as the `onChange` but will be triggered if the input loses
the users focus and triggers the onBlur-Validator.

* `required`: A boolean which indicates if the value `undefined` for "phone"
would pass all validations on that field. If not the value is treated as
required.

The above example shows a form with a single field. 
The label shows "Phone *" if the value is required.
It will update the form data accordingly to the specified `onChange` handler
supplied to the Form.
It will display an error message below the input if any error was encountered.

### Asynchronous form field handling

To implement async form field validation, you simply have to return a promise, which
will resolve the validation result. You can write validators which are both:
**async** *AND* **sync** validator at the same time. One example:

```js
import type { Validator } from 'morfi';

const specialValidator: Validator<string> = (val?: string) => {
    if (!val) { // if value is falsy we return sync error
        return {id: 'value.required'};
    }
    return myFetch('/my/api').then(result => {
        if (result.isInvalid) { // api answered that the value was invalid
            return {id: 'value.invalid'}; // return async error
        }
    });
}
```
HINT: You should always validate the value `undefined` synchronously, because
`morfi` determines the requirements by these criteria. So if you use the comfortable
`async-await`-Syntax, you should split your validator into two parts.

### Control your submit
When the user submits the form, the following will happen:

1) The `submitting` property will be propagated as `true` to your `onChange`
2) All registered validators will be executed and their validation results will be awaited
3) When `2` returned any errors your `onChange` will be called with the found errors and `submitting` as `false` (**Early exit**)
4) When `2` returned no errors your `onSubmit` will be called
5) When `4` took place, the `submitting` property will be propagated as `false` (if your `onSubmit` returned a Promise, this will happen after this Promise resolved)

### Types

**morfi** comes with a lot of types and exports `FormData<T>`, `ErrorMessage`
and `Validator`.

In this table you get an overview of relevant types.

 Name                 | TypeScript declaration                                               | Information
 -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------
 `ErrorMessage`       | `{ id: string, values?: { [key: string]: ReactNode } }`              | This structure allows to handle internationalization by transporting the required information like the intl key and placeholder values
 `MaybeError`         | `ErrorMessage \ void`                                                | This is the returned feedback of each validator
 `Validator<F>`       | `(value?: F) => MaybeError \ Promise<MaybeError>`                    | The validator returns void if no error occurred or a Promise if the validation is asynchronous 
 `ValidationType`     | `'onChange' \ 'onBlur' \ 'onSubmit'`                                 | The validation types that can be specified
 `FieldValidation<F>` | `Partial<{ [key in ValidationType]: Validator<F> }>`                 | An object containing all specified validators for one field
 `FormValidation<V>`  | `Partial<{ [key in keyof V]: FieldValidation<V[key]>}>`              | An object containing all validations for the whole form
 `FormErrors<V>`      | `Partial<{ [key in keyof V]: ErrorMessage }>`                        | An object containing all current errors
 `FormData<V>`        | `{ values: V, errors: FormErrors<V>, submitting?: boolean }`         | This is the main structure for the data represent the form state

Here the corresponding `flow` declarations:

 Name                 | Flow declaration                                                    
 -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------
 `ErrorMessage`       | `{ id: string, values?: { [string]: React$Node} }`                  
 `MaybeError`         | `ErrorMessage \ void` 
 `Validator<F>`       | `(F \ void) => MaybeError \ Promise<MaybeError>`   
 `ValidationType`     | `'onChange' \ 'onBlur' \ 'onSubmit'`                                
 `FieldValidation<F>` | `$Shape<{ [ValidationType]: Validator<F> }>` 
 `FormValidation<V>`  | `$Shape<$ObjMap<V, <F>(F) => FieldValidation<F>>>`                  
 `FormErrors<V>`      | `$Shape<$ObjMap<V, () => ErrorMessage>>`                            
 `FormData<V>`        | `{ values: V, errors: FormErrors<V>, submitting?: boolean }`                            

### Example

In this chapter we will examine how a sample form could be implemented.
The [sample](https://fdc-viktor-luft.github.io/morfi/) is hosted by GitHub Pages.

We first define the types of the form values...
```js
type Gender = 'M' | 'F';
type MyFormValues = {
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    gender: Gender,
    age: number,
};
// gender can be selected with the following available options
const genderOptions = [{ value: 'M', label: 'male' }, { value: 'F', label: 'female' }];
```
Let's initialize the form elements...
```js
const initialValues: MyFormValues = { firstName: 'Nick', lastName: '', gender: 'M', age: 21 };
const { Form, Fields } = Morfi.create(initialValues);
```
Then we define the validations... (see [here](https://github.com/fdc-viktor-luft/morfi/blob/master/src/js/validators/validators.js) for the used validators below)
```js
const validation = {
    firstName: { onChange: Validators.string({ min: 1, max: 10 }) },
    lastName: { onBlur: Validators.string({ min: 1, max: 10 }) },
    age: { onChange: Validators.number({ minLength: 1, maxLength: 3 }) },
};
```
Let's say we decide to control the form state inside our app state...
```js
type AppProps = {};
type AppState = { data: FormData<MyFormValues> };
```
Now we define the first version of the app... (see [here](https://github.com/fdc-viktor-luft/morfi/tree/master/src/js/fields) for all used custom components below)
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Morfi, type FormData } from 'morfi';

(...)

class App extends Component<AppProps, AppState> {
    // first we initialize the defaults
    // we could even start with initial errors
    state: AppState = { data: { values: initialValues, errors: {} } };

    // this handler will propagate the form changes to the state
    onChange = (data: FormData<MyFormValues>) => this.setState({ data });

    // for now we leave the submit handler empty
    onSubmit = ({ gender, firstName, lastName, age }: MyFormValues): void => {
        // do something
    };

    render(): React$Node {
        const { data } = this.state;
        return (
            <Form validation={validation} onChange={this.onChange} data={data} onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
                <div className="row">
                    <FormInput Field={Fields.firstName} label="First name" />
                    <FormInput Field={Fields.lastName} label="Last name" />
                </div>
                <div className="row">
                    <FormSelect
                        Field={Fields.gender}
                        options={genderOptions}
                        label="Gender"
                    />
                    <FormNumberInput Field={Fields.age} label="Age" />
                </div>
                <div className="btn-toolbar">
                    <button type="button" onClick={this.onClear}>
                        Clear
                    </button>
                    <button disabled={Morfi.hasErrors(data)}>
                        Submit
                    </button>
                </div>
            </Form>
        );
    }
}
```
This version does the specified validations on the fields and prevents our empty
`onSubmit` function from being called, when any validations would not succeed.

So now we add a table (see [here](https://github.com/fdc-viktor-luft/morfi/blob/master/src/js/PersonTable.js) 
for the implementation and the new type `Person`) to hold all entered person data. What changes...
```js
// the state interface
type AppState = {| data: FormData<MyFormValues>, persons: Person[] |};
```
```js
// the initial state
state: AppState = { data: { values: initialValues, errors: {} }, persons: [] };
```
```js
// we add below the form the table
<PersonTable persons={this.state.persons} />
```
```js
// we implement functionality for the onSubmit
onSubmit = ({ gender, firstName, lastName = '', age }: MyFormValues): void => {
    this.setState({
        persons: [...this.state.persons, { gender, firstName, lastName, age }],
    });
};
```
Now each time we submit the entered data which succeeds all validations, a new
person entry will be displayed in the `PersonTable`.

Finally we will add a clear button for all inputs and disable the submit button if
any errors are present. What changes...
```js
// a new function inside our App
onClear = () => {
    this.setState({ data: { values: initialValues, errors: {} } });
};
```
```js
// the submit button on the bottom of the form will be replaced by
<div className="btn-toolbar" role="toolbar">
    <button type="button" onClick={this.onClear}>
        Clear
    </button>
    <button disabled={Morfi.hasErrors(data)}>
        Submit
    </button>
</div>
```
Now if we hit the clear button all entered values will be cleared.

### Testing

Check out [morfi-test-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morfi-test-utils) to write your tests
almost as a user would test your form manually.

### FAQ
  
* Why are there no ready-to-use components exported like `FormSelect` 
  from the above examples?
  
  **morfi** is primarily made to handle updates, validations, storing of
  data, assist the developer with strict types and serve as a guideline for form handling.
  
  Later there might be subdirectories which you can optionally use, but most
  often in larger projects you want to have full control over all form components.


### Alternatives...

The following table includes results from [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com).

Package                 | Version | Size (minified + gzipped)
------------------------|---------|--------------------------
`morfi`                 | 1.1.8   | 1.7 kB
`react-form`            | 4.0.1   | 4.5 kB
`redux-form`            | 8.2.6   | 27 kB
`react-redux-form`      | 1.16.14 | 22.5 kB
`formik`                | 2.0.10  | 14.9 kB
`react-final-form`      | 6.3.3   | 3.1 kB + 5.1 kB (hidden peer dependency: `final-form@4.18.6`)
`react-jsonschema-form` | 1.8.1   | 68.8 kB

The following statements represent only my personal opinion, although I did
not work a lot with the following pretty good packages.

* [**react-form**](https://github.com/react-tools/react-form): 
A lot of features, *but* a large package with less flexibility when it comes
to very individual forms. No `flow` support.

* [**redux-form**](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form): 
A lot of features, nice documented and easy to use
form handling tool, *but* it comes with the cost of a little integrative work,
the cost of big package size, forces you to hold the form data in the redux store
and to connect every form and has poor `flow` assistance. Almost the same for
[**react-redux-form**](https://github.com/davidkpiano/react-redux-form).


* [**formik**](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik): 
Indicates what it does better than `redux-form`, *but* is not so much better
because it uses its own pseudo store and pseudo connect-function called
`withFormik` and still is not a very small package.

* [**react-final-form**](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form): 
A lot of features, optimized for performance,
small bundle size, totally customizable and needs no integrative work, 
*but* is not as well documented, has `peerDependecies` which you also need
to install and has no `flow` assistance.

* [**react-jsonschema-form**](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form): 
A lot of features and very nice docs, *but* a large package with less flexibility when it comes
to individual form templating. No `flow` support.
